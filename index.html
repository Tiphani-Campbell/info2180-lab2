     <h2>Beauty In Tech</h2>
     <h3>September 28, 2021 by Tiphani Campbell</h3>
     <p>Ever wondered how two multi-billion dollar industries can come together? 
         And why they should? Through apps of course. Carefully designed apps that
         can cater to most, if not all, your beauty needs. Need skin care advice -
         take a special quiz that could give recommendations for products and even have 
         live sessions with certified dermatologists. 
         <br>
         Want new makeup but don't know
         which products to buy? Makeup quizzes to generate preferences and product recommendations
         and Augmented Reality to try on products without going to the actual store. 
         Very convenient for consumers and brand owners have more reach - come on 
         who doesn't have a smartphone these days!

     <h2>AI And Mental Health</h2>
     <h3>September 27, 2021 by Tiphani Campbell</h3>
     <p>AI is a hot industry right now. It is used in many industries at the moment and 
         many aspects of life. AI could have a great impact on mental health. Not everyone
         has the means to access quality mental health professionals, so apps like Wysa &copy;
         has emerged to provide easier access to tools and materials to aid in bettering one's
         mental health, even providing access to top-tier therapists at the low cost of $2.99 a 
         month.
         <br>
         AI is making it easier and more affordable to access help and it will be beneficial
         for society as more people can reach out for help.
